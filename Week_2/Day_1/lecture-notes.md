If you need to search certain data you should creat object.
Good for searching.

Arrays are good for order of list of things. 

When you change object you are always modifieing the original object.


to loop through array, 
const array = ["test", "test1", "test2", "test3"];

array.forEach((item, index) => {
  console.log(item, index);
});
is the most common one.
